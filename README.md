# Noxford Library
It is a full-stack website for a library. Here you can place a hold for a book, see book information, search for books. Although you can't read any book, it shows you how can nicely build a system like this.<br/>
A user can also register and login into the website to keep track of the books. Further details are given below.

## Technologies
### Frontend
* BootStrap 5
* CSS 3
* EJS
### Backend
* AJAX
* Node JS
* Express JS
  * Express Session
  * Express Layouts

## Login/Register
**Login:** Login system is supported by Express Session. That uses cookie to remember a login session.<br/>
**Register:** Register form is fully functional and supported by HTML Form and JavaScript. However, if anyone manages to pass any unacceptable input, it will be rejected by the server.

## Encryption
For security measures, I've used Bcrypt to hash and protect the passwords. Bcrypt is a password-hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David Mazi√®res, based on the Blowfish cipher and presented at USENIX in 1999.

## Dashboard
The dashboard keeps track of the books that a user has placed a hold on. Anyone can place a hold on any book by logging into the site.

## Search
The search page uses AJAX to show results dynamically. Users can search for a keyword and apply filters to the results. User input always gets sanitized before a search operation execute.
